# In App Web View

An In-App WebView is a feature within a mobile app that allows users to view web content directly inside the app without leaving it to open an external browser. This provides a seamless experience by embedding a lightweight browser into the app. In a Flutter app, the WebView widget is commonly used for this purpose, enabling the display of web pages, loading custom HTML, or interacting with JavaScript. It is useful for integrating external content, such as articles, payment gateways, or documentation, while keeping users engaged within the app environment.

# Custom Search Engine

An In-App Custom Search Engine allows users to search for specific content directly within the app. Unlike traditional search engines, this feature is tailored to the app's content and data, ensuring that users receive more relevant results. It can be integrated with a database, API, or custom data sources to offer a personalized search experience. In a Flutter app, it can be built using widgets like SearchDelegate, along with backend search logic, to provide an intuitive search interface. This feature is ideal for apps that require users to search through products, articles, or other resources in a focused manner.
